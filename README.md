This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health parameters. It aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and decision-making.

Key Features

Objective: Predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease using medical data.

Dataset: Utilized a publicly available dataset containing features like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant health metrics.

Machine Learning Models: Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and other classification algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.

Evaluation Metrics: Analyzed the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization: Included data visualizations for exploratory data analysis (EDA), such as correlation heatmaps and feature importance plots.

Tech Stack

Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Provided insights into the key factors contributing to heart disease, enabling targeted healthcare interventions.

Future Scope

Integration with real-world healthcare systems for live prediction.

Expanding the model to include additional features like genetic predisposition and lifestyle habits.
